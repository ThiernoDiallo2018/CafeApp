        Need to create the top of the main page that has the UILabel Hank Cafe and UIImage of the Coffee
        Will be using StackView to make them neat and close together
        Will need to pass the UIView of this class onto the ViewController
        Might have to make this a UIViewController? or keep it as a UIView? So you can pass it in as a child into the MainViewController
